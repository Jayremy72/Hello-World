# Hello-World
This repository is for practising the GitHub Flow.
Hi, So I'm using the GITHUB tutorial and it's asking me to write something in the README, but I don't know what to write. How Would I know what to write?
This is actually my first time really using a README file for anything. I've seen them everywhere but never had to use one. 
I particulalrly remember them from the BitTorrent downloads I use to find. They always came with a readme and I would sometime look to see but they were often a mess and communicated nothing. 
Still, I think I've written enough for now so, toodles!
